### Documentation
### 2-1 What are testcontainers?
Testcontainers is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.
### 2-2 For what purpose do we need to use secured variables ?
We need to use secured variables to protect sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or API token thus keeping credentials hidden from anyone browsing the repository.
### 2-3 Why did we put needs: build-and-test-backend on this job? Maybe try without this and you will see!
We put needs: test-backend so the Docker image job runs only after tests pass. Without it, the job would start immediately, even if tests fail. It ensures correct order and prevents broken images.
### 2-4 For what purpose do we need to push docker images?
We need to push Docker images so theyâ€™re stored and accessible on Docker Hub, allowing others to pull and run the exact same version of the application easily.
